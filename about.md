# About Mi

Welcome! I'm Mia. (Mi, DG Mi, hey you, whatever!) 

This space is where I explore self-compassion, personal growth, and disc golf - blending life lessons with the game I love. My journey is about learning, evolving, and embracing both victories and setbacks with kindness and grace.

I believe in the power of mindset, resilience, and the simple yet profound act of being kind to yourself. Whether you’re here for disc golf insights, personal reflections, or just a dose of shameless optimism, I’m glad you stopped by!

<summary>🌱 Why I Started This Blog</summary>
<h2>Why I Started This Blog</h2>
For most of my life, I’ve been on a path of constant growth — sometimes intentional, sometimes chaotic. I’ve learned that <b>self-compassion is the foundation for progress</b>, and I wanted a space to share that journey.

Disc golf has become a huge part of my life, not just as a sport but as a mirror for self-improvement. Through every throw, win, and misstep, I see reflections of persistence, self-doubt, and the power of showing up for myself.

This blog is a place to document those lessons, offer encouragement, and remind anyone reading that growth is never linear—but it’s always worth it.

<summary>🏆 My Disc Golf Journey</summary>
<h2>My Disc Golf Journey</h2>
I’ve been competing in professional tournaments the past few years, constantly pushing myself to <i>play the course, not the competition</i> — though that’s easier said than done!

My goal is rarely to win (though, let’s be honest, that’s nice too 🥹), but to become the best version of myself through the sport. Disc golf has taught me patience, adaptability, and how to stay present.

I also track my disc golf progress meticulously, from tournament milestones to the exact lifespan of my discs. (Yes, spreadsheets are my love language. 🖤📊)

<summary>📊 My Other Passion Projects</summary> 
<h2>My Other Passion Projects</h2>
Outside of disc golf, I love <i>tracking random data</i> and creating structured ways to measure growth. My <b>"Year of 36"</b> project is one of my biggest undertakings—an annual reflection and goal-setting system inspired by Groundhog Day Resolutions.

I've always got some ideas and new things I'd like to try up my sleeve...
